# This is the plan on how to complete this project

- [ ] 1. Pass all the tests
- [ ] 2. Check the tests
- [ ] 3. Add missing tests
- [ ] 4. Add new features
- [ ] 5. Add missing documentation

## 1. Pass all the tests
We need to pass all the tests that are here, implementing the features that may be required for that.

## 2. Check the tests
We need to check that the tests that currently exist:

- actually make sense
- are actually doing what they claim they are doing

## 3. Add missing tests
There may be normal cases or corner cases that should be tested but currently aren't.

Find those and create the missing tests.

## 4. Add new features
Now that we have fixed what we have, we still have to complete the project.

So we'll have to write the new tests and features in order to honour the requirements.

## 5. Add missing documentation
The original project wasn't well documented, if at all.

We should add as much documentation as possible.
